Params:
- 4 batches per 256 chan.

Convert to sev
- 3 hours
- no failures.

Kilosort:
- 2/4 ks working fine --> 8-9G on GPU.
- Other 2 crash, likely due to memory on GPU.
- For the 2 running: each max 60-80G (but not simult?). 
- The 2 succeeded.
--> SOLUTION: could reduce size of ops.NT, which is number sample data pts read in per batch. Currently is 65600

try3:
- dates 2 and 3, retry using half batch size:
Here using 512 instead of 1024
ops.NT                  = 64*512+ ops.ntbuff; % must be (multiple of 32) + ntbuff. This is the batch size (try decreasing if out of memory). 
- Results: 17-18 hrs, max RAM 60-75G
- uses ~4G in RAM per run.
