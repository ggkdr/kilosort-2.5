TDT writes binary files using column-order. Note: it actually writes
using C-order, which is row-major, but it first takes transpose of array, which makes this actually 
column major
- line 1931 in TDTbin2py: ddd = np.zeros([nchan, npts], dtype=current_data_format)
- here takes transpose: ddd.astype(export_type, copy=False).T.tofile(file_handle)

KS reads in binary files column-order, which means it will read the TDT files correctly:
- (here says should use matlab's fwrite) https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort/wiki/1.-The-GUI
- matlab's fwrite using column-order (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fwrite.html)
- and here: https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort/issues/189

Concatenation using cat $f/$bin_name >> $sb/$bin_name just does simple concatenation. 
Since this is column order, this works fine. 

CONCLUSION:
- binary files should be correct!
