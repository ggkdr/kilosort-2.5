Running 3-kilosort..Loop.sh, goal is to get 4 going simulit.
Only change from 8/16 is reducing the kilosort batchsize by 1/2,
to:
ops.NT                  = 64*256+ ops.ntbuff; % must be (multiple of 32) + ntbuff. This is the batch size (try decreasing if out of memory). 

previously was

% ops.NT                  = 64*512+ ops.ntbuff; % must be (multiple of 32) + ntbuff. This is the batch size (try decreasing if out of memory). 

==8/18/23 - Only partially complete sev conversion, but did not print any error. nothing is running...
--> No difference in ks memory usage (RAM and GPU) depending on batch size.

PROBLEM (weird):
- 2/4 ks crashed.
- is still taking like 8.5G on RAM, even though is now only 1/4 batch size compared to first test, which also took 8.5G.
