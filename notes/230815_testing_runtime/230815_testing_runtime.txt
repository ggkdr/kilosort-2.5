- 4 runs simult
- 2 bins (i.e. 4 bins per 512 chans)
- 230620 to 230623 (data days), each a separate instance of 3-kilosort...sh

Results:
- only did sev conversion (bug in kilosort code).
- 3/4 had at lease one sev conversion killed.
- mem usage ranged from 32 to 70GB (max)
- duration around 4hrs.

Notes:
- this was before increased swap memory to 64G (was 2G).
- log-1.txt is for sev.
- log-1-ks.txt is for kilosort, but I stopped it early.
